# Sogram

This is a minimal Rust crate to parse .sogram XML spectrogram files in order to
read the data points stored in it. The included sogram tool is a usage example
that prints the data points in an ASCII table that can be plotted.

## Tool Usage Example

```
sogram spectrogram.sogram > spectrogram.txt
```
